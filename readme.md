copy and pasted some code, but i added code for particle freeze and sound  
  
the script freezes every object and players and water, and it will show u frozen from another player's screen  
  
it can be used as invisibility or lagswitch script  
  
it works in [UFO] Life in Prison  
  
press keybind to toggle, if toggled then press keybind to untoggle  
  
if its untoggled then it will set everything back to normal  
  
note: players can still affect u while time halt is toggled, since it basically just pauses everything, but u can also affect other players while paused  
  
pretty fun and cool script  
i like

u can change keybind for (change keybind) script  
but for the other script, the keybind is set to x by default  
  
if u want to test this script u can execute it in a game and have another account of urs join to see whats rly happening.
